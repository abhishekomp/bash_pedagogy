Given this myfile.txt having data about pokemon characters and the 2nd column as the type of character, do the following:
1) Show all the values from the 2nd column i.e. the type of the character.
2) Consolidate the information based on the type columne (2nd column). Show the number of characters per type.
In this case, there are 6 Bugs, 3 Grass and so on.
So the result should be as follows:
   6 Bug
   1 Electric
   3 Fire
   3 Grass
   3 Normal
   3 Water

3) Show the output of Question 2 in a sorted manner (sorted by the count). That is in this way
   1 Electric
   3 Fire
   3 Grass
   3 Normal
   3 Water
   6 Bug
3) Show the output of Question 2 in a sorted manner in reverse order (sorted by the count). That is in this way
   6 Bug
   3 Fire
   3 Grass
   3 Normal
   3 Water
   1 Electric
